# Omniverse

Omniverse is a CTCG or Creatable Trading Card Game. Anyone can make cards for playing or
trading according to any theme or concept, provided that the cards adhere to the rules 
of Omniverse. 

The game itself is played between two players, each with a deck of 50 cards of their
choosing.

## Where do I get cards?

If you don't know somebody making cards or you don't want to make cards for yourself yet,
you can get a premade deck of cards by either printing them out [from this PDF](url.pdf)
or purchasing a deck [here](url.html).

## How to Play
The goal of the game is to be the first to earn 6 _Honor_. Honor is earned by defeating
your opponent's _Contestants_ by using your own _Contestants'_ abilities. 

### Essence
To defeat a rival _Contestant_, you must deplete their  _Essence_. Essence is the 
fundamental unit of capability in the Omniverse. All things that have a certain amount of 
Essence that is depleted or restored during the competition. When something's Essence
is depleted, it must be removed from the competition.

Each Contestant starts with a certain amount of essence, depending on how much Honor is
awarded for defeating them: a Contestant that awards 1 Honor has 30 Essence, a Contestant
that awards 2 Honor has 60 Essence, and so on.

### Actions & Power
Each Contestant may have up to two _Actions_ at their disposal. In order to perform these
actions, the Contestant must have enough _Power_ to do so. Power is only available through
_Resources_, which provide Power to Contestants - and sometimes to Artifacts - every turn.

### Artifacts
_Artifacts_ assist your Contestants, by providing Essence or offering new capabilities.

### The Game
Each player shuffles their deck and draws six cards. The youngest player goes first.

A turn has three steps:
1. **Prepare**: Draw a card and place up to one Resource card face up. Apply any effects
   to your contestants.
2. **Act**: For each contestant in play, either pair it to an opponent contestant or take
   one action, but not both. Play any number of actions from cards in your hand.
3. **New Contestant**: Put up to one contestant card in play.

When a card's Essence is depleted, it is removed from play and discarded. If the card
is a contestant, its honor is awarded to the attacking player. The first player to earn 
6 Honor wins.

It is highly encouraged, but not required, for players to trade one card at the end of
the game.

## Creating Cards
Omniverse cards can be created by anyone. There is no "authentic" manufacturer of cards - 
anything that adheres to the rules of Omniverse is a valid Omniverse card. Furthermore,
since Omniverse is a contest of universes, there is not restrictions for theme, concepts,
artistic medium, or complexity. Cards can be super-powered creatures, fantastic wizards,
rock musicians, intelligent mattresses, historical figures, or even abstract concepts.

You're also encouraged to make sets of cards that tell a story, develop a theme, or
establish a visual style. You can make cards that only work with one another, or even
build additional game mechanics into your cards, so long as they follow the rules of 
Omniverse.

The point here is to enable anyone to be able to express themselves with cards within a 
common game everyone can play.

### Physical Specifications

All physical specifications are recommendations, since Omniverse cards vary tremendously
depending on the creator. In order for competitive play to be more standardized, the only
requirement is that cards must all fit in a standard card sleeve. It's also preferable to
have the backs of all cards be the same, so a 
[backed card sleeve](https://www.dragonshield.com/) is ideal.

Cards should be 2.5 inches by 3.5 inches (64mm X 89mm) and preferably no thicker than 
1/50th of an inch or 1/2mm. One side should provide all the details necessary for using
the card in the game. The opposing side should be a generic pattern or motif. The
recommended Omniverse card back can be found [here](omniverse/back-small.png).

### Basic Cards
To start, the following set of rules are recommended for making cards. Remember that the
way these cards present abilities, power, etc. is completely up to the creator of the
card. Contestants can deplete essence by outsmarting, out-dancing, or even 
out-complimenting their opponent.

- Competitors can have either 30 Essence and 1 Honor, or 60 Essence and 2 Honor
- Resource cards supply 1 Power per turn
- Actions can use 1 Power to either heal or deplete 5 Essence on any competitor, or 2
  Power to heal or deplete 10 Essence. 
- Artifacts can:
    (a) Heal or deplete 10 Essence.
    (b) Provide a new action to a competitor that follows the rules defined above
- Actions and Artifacts can have their effect doubled on a successful coin flip, provided
  they perform no effect on a failed coin flip (e.g. "double or nothing")
- Actions and Artifacts can draw out their changes to Essence over multiple turns by 
  applying an effect on a competitor (e.g. poison or a temporary shield)
- Actions and Artifacts can disable a competitor for one turn for 2 Power (e.g. stun)
- An Artifact can have the ability to remove an opponent Resource card from play

### Full Card Creation Rules
If you want to explore beyond the basic card concepts outline above, the rules for 
card-making must be followed to ensure that the card is interesting and fair for use in 
the game. The basic cards above already follow these rules, so sometimes the best way to
make a new kind of card is to modify the basic cards to do something special while 
adhering to these rules.

1.  Contestant cards start with 30 _Essence_ per _Honor_ awarded, and up to two
    actions.
2.  Artifacts provide a single _Action_ that can utilize 10 _Essence_.
3.  Resource cards provide 1 _Power_ every turn to any active contestants.
4.  Actions may convert _Power_ or _Essence_ to increase or decrease the _Essence_ of any
    cards in play. Actions may apply effects that happen over time.
5.  An action can result in the removal of a Resource from play by depleting exactly 10 
    Essence from it.
6.  All actions and their resulting effects must be balanced by following the conversion: 
     **1 Honor = 30 Essence = 6 Power**
7.  An Action may disable another Contestant's Action for a single turn at a cost of 5 
    _Essence_ or 1 _Power_. 
8. An Action may disable another Contestant may be disabled for a single turn at a cost 
    of 10 _Essence_ or 2 _Power_.
9. Statistically random events can be used in conjunction with an Action, so long as the 
    expected value of the Action is balanced.
10. Artifacts and Resources may provide more _Essence_ or _Power_ if they are only usable
    by a subset of competitors in the players deck. The additional amount must be
    inversely proportional to the fraction of competitors that can use the card.
11. Cards that can be proven to be made by the creators of Omniverse are legal for 
    non-competitive play, or for competitive play in which both players agree to their 
    use. These cards often break the rules defined above.
